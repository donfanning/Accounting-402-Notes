If retained earnings is one of the accounts that requires adjustment due to a change in accounting principle (and it usually is), we must adjust the beginning balance of the retained earnings account for the earliest period reported in the comparative statements of shareholders equity.

The amount of the revision is the cumulative effect of the change of years prior to that date.

| - | - | $ in millions | Common Stock | APIC | Retained Earnings | Total S/E

Jan 1, 2016 | - | - | $880
  net income | - | - | $186
  dividends | - | - | $(40)
December 31, 2016 | - | - | $1,026
  net income (revised to FIFO) | - | - | $195
  dividends | - | - | $(40)
December 31, 2017 | - | - | $1,187
  net income (using FIFO) | - | - | $210
  dividends | - | - | $(40)
December 31, 2018 | - | - | $1,357

# Adjust accoaunts for the change

$ in millions | 2017 | 2016 | Cumulative difference pre-2016 | Cumulative difference pre-2018
Cost of Goods Sold (LIFO) | 420 | 405 | 1,000 | -
Cost of Goods Sold (FIFO) | 365 | 360 | 7000 | -
  Difference | 55 | 45 | 300 | 400

The $400 million cumulative difference in CGS is also the difference between the balance in inventory and what that balance would have been if the FIFO method, rather than LIFO, had been used before 2018. Inventory must be increased to that amount.
Retained earnings must be increased by 60% of that amount due to income taxes.

# Journal entry to record change in accounting principle

dr. Inventory (Additional inventory if FIFO had been used) | 400 | -
  cr. Retained earnings (additional net income if FIFO had been used) | - | 240
  cr. Income tax payable ($400 x 40%) | - | 160


# Modified retrospective approach

We apply the new standard only to the adoption period (that is, the current period) and then adjust the balance of retained earnings at the beginning of the adoption period to capture the cumulative effects of the prior periods without actually adjusting the numbers in the prior periods reported.

# Prospective Approach: When retrospective is impracticable

Two types:

1. When it is impracticable to determine sokme period-specific effects
2. When it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of prior years

# Prospective Approach: When mandated by authoritative accounting literature

# Prospective Approach: Changing depreciation, amortization, and depletion methods

A change in depreciation methods is considered to be a change in accounting estimate through a change in accounting principle. It is taken care of prospectively.

# Change in accounting estimates

Accounting tasks that require changes to accounting estimates

1. Anticipating uncollectible accounts receivable
2. Predicting warranty expenses
3. Amortizing intangible assets
4. Making acturial assumptions for pension benefits

The revision of the estimate constitutes the correction of a error

Changes in accounting estimates are accounted for prospectively. When a company revises a previous estimates, prior financial statements are not revised. The company merely incorporates the new estimate from then on. A disclosure note should describe the effect of a change in estimate on income from continuing operations, net income, and related per share amounts for the current period.
